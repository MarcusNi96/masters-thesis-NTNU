\chapter{Introduction}
Just testing git
While LLM´s and more generalized AI are hyped in the media, more specialized AI are still a very powerful tool. Espeshal whit the widely available things that are available to us today, like pre trained CNN´s, cheap single board computers, cameras and open source software.

In this thesis the possiblities of implementing mashine learning to classify the surface rpughness of machinede surfaces will be explored. The goal here is to use off the shelf hardware to build a cemera that can be used lathes to image samples. Goals simple as spossible, COTS and 3d printing, software to capture dataset will be modifed from open source projects to reduce development time and the possibilities to us transfer learing with models strained on hughe datasets like image net. This way the feasbilyti of this method will be tested out, and a prodotype will be ,ade that can be developted further to integrate with computers on the lathe.
